Perfect choice! The Text Analysis Tool is great for building a solid foundation—it lets you explore core Python skills like string handling, data analysis, and visualization, while also giving you a chance to learn some light NLP and AI prompting in a manageable way. Plus, it’s flexible enough to be as simple or advanced as you want.

Next steps you might want to consider:

Start planning your features (e.g., word/character count, sentiment analysis, word cloud).

Think about input methods (text box, file upload, or paste-in terminal).

Begin setting up a modular structure—functions for different tasks.

Design some intentional prompts (like: “Summarize the main topic of this text” or “Extract key entities”).

Let me know if you want help outlining your features, planning the code structure, or writing your next assignment section. You've got this! 💪
