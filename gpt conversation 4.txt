hey chat can you explain the re. sub in function 2 of cleaning text


ChatGPT said:
Hey! Absolutely ‚Äî let's break down the re.sub() part from your Function 2: clean_text() üëá

üîç Code Recap
python
Copy
Edit
import re

def clean_text(text):
    # Convert to lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    # Remove punctuation using regex
    text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', text)
    return text
üß™ What is re.sub()?
re.sub() stands for substitute in the re (regular expression) module.

python
Copy
Edit
re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)
It looks for things that match the pattern and replaces them with the replacement.

üîç Let's look at this line:
python
Copy
Edit
text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', text)
üí° Breakdown:
Part	Meaning
r'[^\w\s]'	A regular expression (regex) pattern
^	Means "NOT these things"
\w	Matches any word character (letters, digits, underscore)
\s	Matches any whitespace (space, tab, newline)
So, [^\w\s]	Matches anything that‚Äôs NOT a letter, number, underscore, or space ‚Äî i.e., punctuation!
''	Means: replace with nothing (delete it)
text	The string you're cleaning
üîÑ In Plain English:
It removes punctuation like ., !, ?, ,, @, etc.
It keeps letters, numbers, and spaces.

‚úÖ Example
python
Copy
Edit
text = "Hello, world! Let's clean this: now."
cleaned = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', text)
print(cleaned)
Output:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
Hello world Lets clean this now


hey chat why do i get this error message on the main program when trying to input a text


ChatGPT said:
Hey! Let's get you sorted out. üëá

If you're getting an error when trying to input text in the main program (especially right after selecting "Enter new text"), it's likely one of these common issues:

üîç 1. get_user_input() is not defined
You might see something like:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
NameError: name 'get_user_input' is not defined
‚úÖ Fix: Make sure you have this function defined above your main_menu() function or imported properly.

Here‚Äôs the correct function for reference:

python
Copy
Edit
def get_user_input():
    print("\nPlease enter your text below.")
    print("(Press Enter twice to finish):")
    lines = []
    while True:
        line = input()
        if line == "":
            break
        lines.append(line)
    return " ".join(lines)

ChatGPT said:
Ah, got it! That error is super common and really easy to fix! üí°

üß† Why it's happening:
You're accidentally pasting the text directly into the menu prompt, instead of choosing an option first.

üìã What PyInputPlus is expecting:
When it shows:

sql
Copy
Edit
Please select one of the following:
1. Enter new text
2. Show text statistics
...
It wants you to choose a number (like 1, 2, etc.) to select a menu option.

üß® What you're doing instead:
You're pasting a full paragraph like this:

csharp
Copy
Edit
Python is an amazing programming language! It‚Äôs used in web development...
And PyInputPlus says:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
'Python is an amazing programming language!...' is not a valid choice.
Because it's not one of the menu items (1, 2, etc.).

‚úÖ What to do instead:
When the menu appears:

sql
Copy
Edit
Please select one of the following:
1. Enter new text
2. Show text statistics
...
Type 1 and press Enter to choose "Enter new text".

Then it will say:

scss
Copy
Edit
Please enter your text below.
(Press Enter twice to finish):
‚úÖ Now you can paste your paragraph like this:

kotlin
Copy

You said:
it still doesnot give an enter text prompt after choosing an option


ChatGPT said:
Ah okay, let‚Äôs fix this together step-by-step. If you're choosing option 1 but it doesn‚Äôt prompt you to enter text, it likely means the get_user_input() function is not properly defined, not in the same file/cell, or not executed before calling main_menu().


after running the main_menu() this was the output or the functioning


ChatGPT said:
Awesome! Drop the output or describe what you saw ‚Äî I‚Äôll help you from there. Was it the menu working as expected? Did it let you enter your own text and see the stats or graphs?

Let me know what worked, what didn‚Äôt, or if there‚Äôs an error. I got you!

ChatGPT said:
Thanks for sharing the output! The issue is clear now ‚Äî when you choose "1. Enter new text", it doesn't prompt you to actually enter any text. It just jumps back to the menu, and when you try again, it loops, eventually giving the "Blank values are not allowed" error from pyinputplus.

üîç Likely Cause:
Your main_menu() function calls get_user_input() ‚Äî but that function might not be defined in the notebook or isn‚Äôt working as expected. If it's missing, Python skips it silently when running in Colab or Jupyter.

‚úÖ Fix Steps:
Here‚Äôs what you should do:

1. Make sure this function is defined before running main_menu():
python
Copy
Edit
def get_user_input():
    print("\nPlease enter your text below.")
    print("(Press Enter twice to finish):")
    lines = []
    while True:
        line = input()
        if line == "":
            break
        lines.append(line)
    return " ".join(lines)
üëâ Paste this at the top of your notebook, before main_menu() is defined or run.

2. Run everything again in order:
Define all your functions:

get_user_input()

clean_text()

calculate_statistics()

get_word_frequencies()

visualise_frequencies()

main_menu()

Then finally call:

python
Copy
Edit
main_menu()
üîÅ How It Should Work After Fixing:
You choose:

arduino
Copy
Edit
1. Enter new text
Then it should ask:

scss
Copy
Edit
Please enter your text below.
(Press Enter twice to finish):
Then you type something like:

csharp
Copy
Edit
Python is powerful and simple.
It is widely used in AI and data science.

[press Enter again]
And now it should analyze and return to the menu ‚úÖ
